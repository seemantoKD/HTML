        <p align="justify">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational 
        language used to create the structure of all websites on
        the internet. It is not a programming language, but a markup language,
        which means it is used to "mark up" or define the structure of web content
        HTML tells the web browser how to display text, 
        images, links, videos, buttons, forms, and many other elements on a webpage. 
        It uses a system of tags, such as html, head, title, body, h1 to h6,
        p, img, a, and many more. These tags usually come in pairs — an opening tag 
        and a closing tag — and the content goes between them. For example, p This is a 
        paragraph.p creates a paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>
        HTML alone creates the structure of a webpage but does not make it visually 
        attractive — that's where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in. 
        CSS is used along with HTML to style elements like colors, fonts, spacing, 
        layout, and more. Additionally, JavaScript is often used with HTML to make 
        the webpage interactive, such as responding to user clicks, filling out forms, or 
        creating animations. HTML is extremely important because every webpage — from 
        simple blogs to complex web apps — starts with an HTML document. It is also easy 
        to learn, making it the first step for anyone starting their journey into web 
        development. Whether you're building a personal website or a full-scale web 
        application, a solid understanding of HTML is essential.</p>
